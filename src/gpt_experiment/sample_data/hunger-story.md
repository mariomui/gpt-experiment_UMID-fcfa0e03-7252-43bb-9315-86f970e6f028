Jason licked his lips, and watched as his older brother ate from afar. When the caravans had stopped, Canard scurried to a kitchen-wagon to eat within the protection of the older boys. He did not bring his little brother along. Canard could hold a grudge forever.  
He slumped over a wheel, clutching his stomach. He had not eaten in a quarter-moon. 
There were dozens of bare feet, and ragged trousers passing him by. They were once his neighbors, who in better times, would have helped him. Instead, they averted their gaze, fearful of him. Not because of his physique. He was barely taller than their upper thighs. No, they were scared of bringing attention to themselves—everyone was hungry; violence and thievery needed but an excuse.
His eyes went to the sea-cliffs. The leader had chosen this road because guarding three sides was easier than four. But that meant, no nearby forest, no game, no berries, no way to climb down to the beach to crack open some delicious shell-swimmers, only salty wind, and inedible grass, lots of it.
To Stix with it. He strode over to his brother. He lunged for the loaf of bread. But he was only twelve rings old, while Canard was sixteen. Canard caught his wrist, then jabbed, smashing the soft bones of his hand into his face repeatedly. The ground rushed at him as he lost balance. Crusty soil shifted under his cheek. His ripped lower lip stung as he licked the salty air around it.
	“Thieving from your own brother? Wretch.”
	A bird with shimmering feathers of blue floated by Canard’s head. Bluebird had eight eyeballs, four upon each of her wings. They blinked.
	 She, as usual, had an opinion.
	—Kill him. You only need to say the word.
	No! Jason shoved this thought with force. Bluebird shrieked, faded away. 
	“Come near me, again,” said Canard. “And I’ll throw you over that sea-cliff.”
	Jason nodded.
	“Now, git. Out of my sight, groundling.”
Canard could really hold a grudge.
A quarter-moon ago, Jason had inadvertently revealed their stash when he shared a morsel with an elderly man. Not long after, both Canard and he were beaten, their knapsacks upturned, with their travel rations amongst other irreplaceables, stolen. He wished he were strong enough so that the town didn’t have to devolve to baser instincts. Pa oft quoted: Goodness in men, given time and opportunity, would win out. 
Jason sniffed. The fault lay with the hunger and hardship; Canard and the townspeople would return to normal, once the traveling was over. He hoped.
	“Attention!” came a voice from the main-caravan.
The leader was mouthing off again. Jason tried to remember his name. Fran…Franklun? This Franklun only protected the merchant caravan, and ignored all else. “Not a watchman,” he had said. “Paid to look after the goods, and to prevent the horses from being stole. That is all. You’ve arms and legs, use them! And don’t touch my horses!”
Still, were it not for Franlin’s employer, the kindly Mercer Hayes, accepting them into protection, then Jason and his fellow outcasted townsfolk would have long been picked clean. The road, in the best of times, was filled with brigands that thought little of personal rights. Now? In times of famine? [ Too repetitive?
Mario 8/29/22, 7:52 PM]There were rumors that the larger bands were resorting to behaving like Almost-men.
 Franklun was still talking: “…one candle’s time. Make your forages now. We won’t wait for you.” He hesitated, then said, “Last night. Did the lot of you hear a whistle?”
Of course. That electric crackle could have wakened the dead.
	“That is what we call, in our business, a clarion spell,” he continued. “A call for help. Another escort group. Attacked by Almost-men[ Should I do a red herring to promise thieves will attack?
Mario 8/29/22, 7:38 PM]. So keep an eye out, lest you be trundled off. Might find yourself invited to dinner.” He and his circle laughed. Jason did not.
He refused to listen further, rather choosing to hustle over to the northern grasses for a last attempt at foraging.  After all, Franklun was only blustering again, to posture his worth, and using their fear to gather coin. With the gray morning pouring its light upon the steppes, a spotter could see far; it would take a miracle for any pursuer to catch Franlin’s team unawares. 
Jason swatted away a grass mite creeping up his exposed shoulder. A ridiculous thought came over him, about how skinny he was, that no blatt would think he a good meal. That was not true, of course. The roads were filled with buzzing corpses; the insects feasted aplenty on variety, male or female, young and old, with room at their table for millions more of their ilk.


Jason tripped over a rock; pain shot through his bare feet, and he tumbled down. At least, he was alone, so no one could see him cry. 
Dead grass crackled behind his rested head. Was it the older kids’ crew that had stolen his shoes a fortnight ago? Or…maybe…the Almost-men? He pictured a group of flesh-eaters bursting through the tallgrass. Scrambling to his feet, he snatched a nearby stone to use as a weapon. In his hand, however, was a mushroom. He waved it as menacingly as he could.
	“Hello, little brother,” came the unseen voice.
	Not a cannibal. Worse. It was Canard.
	“The others were watching. You can’t eat with me when the others are watching. They mustn’t know I care about you. Otherwise, they’d only beat you again, then blackmail me for my food.”
	Canard’s hand held a half-eaten taro-loaf. A few blatts flew on it, but it was still the most delicious peace offering that Jason had ever seen. He reached out but froze midway. A thought nagged upon his heart. Who could brother steal from? Ever since Kevic’s baby sister had died, nobody else were younger, were weak enough to prey upon.
	It had to be Old Tenna. She had no one. Her sons had all been marched to war, then, to the last boy, returned to her within wooden boxes. Yet, even in these desperate times, no one stole from her. After all, she had midwifed almost every child in town. She taught children to write their names, do maths. She was a friend of the family.
	“Return the bread to Tenna.”
	“You haven’t eaten since the half-moon passed. Don’t be stupid.”
	Jason held up a brown mushroom. “I’ve found this to dine on, instead.”
	“Dying from hunger too normal? You seek a more painful death with poison?”
	“The groundlings nibble on these. See the bite marks? It’s safe. I think.”
	“I’d soon not trust my life to the eyes of a child.,” said Canard. He offered the bread again. “Eat. This food is better off in you than in her. Tenna’s foot is half in the grave. It’d be like wasting food.”
	“Pa wouldn’t want us to live unrighteously.”
	Canard snarled.
	“Enough. With. Pa.” said Canard. He pointed upwards. “You think Pa’s in Asdonusila? No, he’s in the Bad Place, where they keep all the failures, those who’ve ruined their family.”
 	Canard ranted on. “Following his lead, we dug ditches, fix bridges, heaped sandbags…Yet, when the time came, NO one spoke up to defend him. Not one.”
	“Finding fault in the weak is…the coward’s path,” said Jason. Pa had said that often to Canard.
	“Such wisdom,”  spat Canard. “Pa’s bedtime tales have poisoned your mind. Tell me. Do heroes get hung by their thumbs? Do their guts spill over their legs like rope?” His spittle flew wildly causing Jason to flinch. Eventually calmed, Canard continued: “He was a fool.”
	His face lay seven fingers away from Jason’s. “And fools deserve to die.”
Jason barreled into his brother. The crusty ground shifted under their combined weight. Ere winter, the topsoil was dried, shallow-rooted, in this way, the grass conserved their strength. The grass was smarter than he was. Eventually, his brother ended on top, with two knees pinning him to the soil.
	“Eat,” said Canard, shoving the loaf into Jason’s mouth. “Please. I can’t lose you, too. I just can’t.”
	“No.”
	The morning light shifted. All Jason could remember was pain. Canard punched at the right places, minimal lasting damage, maximum pain. Mostly numb, Jason could still feel a little. His throat was shoved moist bread repeatedly. When it was over, Canard rolled over, laughing hysterically.
Many a times, after an exhaustive workday[ I would love a more of a word budget here to extend this scene. But I am 300 words over
Mario 8/29/22, 10:58 PM], they would lay upon their backs to stare upwards, to contemplate gray-blue clouds, or cheer a young eagle’s first hunt. Jason tasted his tears but his heart was strangely unemotional.
Just then, an electric crackle surged through the air, causing his hair to stand on end but it was his brother who responded first. 
Canard knelt upwards, turned his head toward the sound, like a groundling on alert for predators. His unique eyes saw far. Mother had joked that Canard was adopted, what with his green eyes so different than their brown. His eyes were wide, no doubt seeing something frightening. 
No one spoke. Jason heard the booming sound again. Franlin’s signature clarion spell. 
Almost-men, realized Jason. The flesh-eaters. At the caravan.




	“I have to help them.”
	“Agreed, we flee—wait, what?”
	Jason swallowed, cleared his throat of stolen bread. 
	—Why don’t you tell him the truth? Bluebird sat herself upon Canard’s head. 
	—Tell him why he’s starving. Homeless. Tell him who’s real fault it is. The Almost-men will be your doom. This is your last chance at honesty. Take it.
	Jason ignored Bluebird, even though he did want to be honest. Just the mention of the truth made his heart ache, made him want to hug his shins, and slam head-first into the ground. 
	“I’m done running,” Jason mumbled.  “Franlin’s a journey-mage—on bones, the fight should be equal, if the townsfolk join him.”
	“I could force you,” Canard said. “I’d rather not. But I will.”
	Now was a good time to be honest, Jason thought. With at least this much.
	Jason summoned the Bluebird, muttering a Bargain. An orange ball slid from the Bluebird’s wing to Jason’s head. He wondered how it would look to his brother. The Mouth of Power was the most hideous of the Eight gifts. It was an eyeball where the eyelashes and pupils were replaced by orange lips and fangs. He focused a Word to near his brother’s feet, Un-Made the ground so that it became a steaming putrefied slop of sludge and orange vapor.
	Canard screamed. He ran off north. 
	Flee far, brother. Flee true, thought Jason. Flee from the monsters. 
	With a chuckle that turned to sob, Jason ran south, toward the screams.


—Danger. Drop down to your knees. 
Jason, still running at full speed, bent a knee. A sword sailed harmlessly, slightly snipping the tip of a wayward hairstrand. The wielder of the sword stumbled. The enemy had expected resistance—Jason’s neck. The enemy was smallish—no,  an Almost-man? No, but similar. A dwarf-sized version. An Almost-ling? 
Skidding to a stop, Jason aimed his Mouth, launched a Word of Power…and missed. Luckily, the Almost-ling had fled, dropping a sword, even.
—He’ll return. With friends. Make another bargain. Whilst you still have time to prepare.
A howl arose from the west, where the Almost-ling had disappeared to.
—I hear at least two Almost-men loping toward you.
The bluebird flew upwards, circled twice and returned to perch on his shoulder.
—-And something else is coming. Something dark. Something old, far older than I. By the Tetrad, it is an Elder One. I had thought they extinct.
“From your legends?” Jason said. He forgot to breathe. He demanded “a Word, Bluebird. Now!” then began a chant, saying words he understood but with sounds he did not. “I make the bargain. I give you a single memory. The last consonant of twenty-nine.” 
Unbidden, he recalled a memory of a younger himself when Tenna was teaching him how to write the letter `z`. The memory vanished. He would know it was there, like a dangling word at the tip of his tongue, but he would never be able to remember it ever again.
—A Mouth of Power would alert the approaching Elder One to my presence. It would doom both you and I. Use the Seeker’s Eye, instead. The least powerful of the eight Gifts, yes, but almost undetectable, and when utilized correctly, more useful by far.” 
Jason felt the letter z return to his mind. The Bird had broken the Bargain.
A single eye on Bluebird’s wing closed. A tear welled up from this eye, the shape and size of a small red crystal. It plopped off like an hen’s egg, then dashed into Jason’s skull. As usual, the insertion was painful, but not too much. His skin and hair shifted around, acclimating themselves to their new ‘guest’.
Before Bluebird dissipated into a wisp, she had spoken softly, to herself, but Jason’s keen ears had overheard. She had said “I hope you survive, child.” 


The Seeker's Eye slithered to his forehead’s center. Color faded from the world as the Eye took control. To the northwest, the Almost-ling was blowing into a skull, and the skull was howling like a trapped beast. To the northeast, the Eye sensed two presences. Two Almost-men, moving in tandem, with speed.
There was a third. The Seeker’s Eye saw past the tallgrass, attempted to zoom into the third’s face, and promptly failed. The man was hazy, like a dark dream. Jason squinted, fed the Eye another memory, when his mother taught him how to write the vowel ae. The man finally came into view. He was large, clad from neck to toe in black steel, and sported a red cape. The man wore a silver facemask, the ones a shaman would wear to beg the rain to pour. The Black Knight stopped suddenly, holding up a gauntleted fist.
Impossibly, the metal lips on the Black Knight’s mask parted, and from its gaping hollow came forth a bolt of purple. Pain surged inside Jason. He fell to a knee. 	
Time slowed. The Eye felt white-hot. Jason was suddenly outside himself. The world was gray; he saw a version of himself shimmer like water. Three wraith-like figures burst from the grass. A wire wrapped around the neck of the Jason-copy. The Black-Knight-copy yanked. The blood on the wire glistened.
The world reversed. He saw his imitation-self running. It met up with Franklun. The Almost-men used pilums to  pierce Franlin’s shield, then released, using the weight of the wooden poles to slow Franklun enough for them to tackle him. As for the Jason-shadow, a separate set of pilums had rained down, skewering him where he stood.
The Eye abruptly went cold. 
Well, that was new, he thought as his senses returned. The vison was clear. Die now, or die later.  He picked up the Almost-ling’s dropped sword from earlier, and ran south to Franklun.
Die later, then.







Jason saw an overturned caravan, its cosmetics spread over the soil. The Almost-men were only interested in people. Women and children were being hauled off in nets. The Eye spotted Franklun. He, and the remaining survivors had retreated to the cliff. A few wagons were used as makeshift barricades. Stuck upon their wooden frames pinned dozens of pilum shafts, some with dead men in between.
Jason weaved from side to side, avoiding spear after spear. The earlier vision had helped predict the spear paths, and the Eye would remind him when he mis-predicted. 
“Impressive, kid,” said Franklun. Blood dripped from his sword-arm. “Want a job?” 
Jason spoke fast. “Is this all the survivors? All your men?”
“All that’s living, aye.”
Jason stepped in, chopping the two spears aiming to hook into Franlin’s shield. 
“How the…”
“Never mind the how.” Jason re-phrased his thoughts. “There is a monster about to arrive that you’ve no hope to fight. Have you your magic?”
“Not enough to fight with. Spent most of it supporting my daughter’s escape. I was hoping that we would last until reinforcements arrived.” His face lost some of its fierceness.
“Can you call them to return? With the clarion spell?”
“You want my eldest daughter to die with me?”
Jason told him the plan. 
“That’s insane,” said Franklun. 
“So that’s a yes, then.”
“I don’t understand how you’re going to be able to stop him. If he’s as powerful as you say.”
“You saw what I could do,” said Jason. He swiveled, accurately predicting yet another volley of thrown pilums. “But afterwards, promise me that you’ll look after my fellow townsmen. See them safe. Apprentice all the younger children so they won’t go hungry.”
“Kid, if you get me out of this alive, I’ll bake the moons into pie, and hand-feed you.”
Jason laughed. He was so tired. In truth, whether or not they succeeded, there were no possible futures where he existed. But there was one where he could share this doom with the Black Knight, as long as Franklun played his part.
“This is it, Franklun. I’m depending on you.”
The Black Knight arrived. The Almost men stopped their attacks. They…kneeled.
Franklun eyebrows were scrunched in doubt but he took Jason’s handwritten note as instructed. With a kiss, the parchment burned in blue fire, then shot up into the sky, smashed into gray skies splashing electrical blue cacophony everywhere. Jason handed him a chalk of orangey realgar. He was grumbling to himself, even as he walked forward to meet the Black Knight. He covered his forehead with his hood.
“Well met, Elder One,” he said. “By the Citrus---” Jason frowned at Franlin’s mistake. “—I mean, Tetrad, I welcome thee to these lands.”
The Black Knight froze. His voice was foreign, not monstrous. Almost song-like.
“How odd. How do you come by these terms?” The Black Knight sat down on a a makeshift seat instantly formed by a throng of crawling Almost-men.
“I knew your kind when it was before the dark,” recited Franklun, even as he sometimes glared at Jason, as if to say, ‘what is this insane dialogue’. He continued: “I had thought you extinct. Should we come to a bargain?”
“Ah, the old magic from before. I thought I sensed you.”
Amidst the Black Knight’s laughter, Franklun said, “These people are under my protection!” 
While they were talking, Jason held his breath, and forcibly summoned Bluebird. She appeared but she was tiny, and hid inside his tousled hair.
—You dare reveal my presence to Ornias! When he finds me, he will eat me alive!”
Jason said, “He thinks Franklun is you. You’re in no danger. Answer me quick. Can this ‘Ornias’ be killed? If I offer you the rest of me?”
Bluebird laughed. ’—The rest of your consonants is strong power, indeed. But it would only annoy him.’ Jason saw her beak shiver, a sign that her interest had piqued. ‘—Oh. You are offering something more. It could hurt him, maybe.’
“I need him destroyed. Not hurt.”
—The closer you are to him, the stronger the Word, the Unmaking. But I make no guarantees.
While Jason prepared, periodically, he watched Franlin’s performance. Franklun survived yet.
“I grow weary of talk,” said the Black Knight, standing up quickly. He took out a baton. A crimson liquid poured from an end before braiding itself into a wire. It writhed like it was alive. “You have nothing to offer. Our bargain adjourns.” 
Franklun doffed his hood, revealing his forehead where he had drawn two lips with a stick of orange realgar. “Beware! I wield the Sword of Power!”
 Jason winced.
“Am I to be cowed by a single Word of Unmaking from one measly Mouth?” laughed the Black Knight. His baton’s crimson wire lengthened, gave a brighter red glow. “How long have you been a host? From what I saw, your fighting has been skilled, for a mortal. Given time to grow, you’d have been a mighty power. Might have been a king, mayhaps. Alas.” The Black Knight’s red weapon lashed out, incredibly lengthy. Even with Jasons’ early forewarning of the Knights’ unique abilities, Franlin’s dodge was barely in time.
Franklun ripped two hidden pieces of paper on his legs. He was an amazing blur, dodging impossible attacks. The wagons, however, were diced to oblivious. The ground he stood on was gashed, and uneven. His clothes were in tatters, fibers, flesh, and blood. Bluebird shook her head denying Jason’s desire to rush out to the rescue. Not until the Bargain finished processing.
From the tall grasses to the north, came a dozen men, led by a tall girl, a face full of war-paint. Oddly, Jason was reminded of Canard. Their bluster was similar. 
“Not one!” bluffed the girl. “But a hundred!” Behind her, a thin line of men appeared. Drawn upon their foreheads were lip-shaped mud clumps that one could mistake for actual lips. If one were blind. The Black Knight was not for he ordered his troops to “Kill them all!” The Almost-men cocked their ears as if listening to unheard commands, then they formed v-shaped wedges before surging to attack the girl and her far-less-than-a-hundred retinue. The Black Knight was done palavering.
The blood wire wrapped wide, surrounding Franklun so that he could not escape. The noose tightened, and….Jason jumped in. He threw a flagon of spiced wine at the wire, then rushed toward the Black Knight with his sword. 
The blood wire fizzled, and disappeared. The Black Knight’s face was emotionless but Jason’s Eye could sense fury. Jason stabbed into him. 
The sword shattered; Jason could hear his arm snap. The Black Knight’s boot was on his neck, pressing downward. “You think I a fool? Mouths of Power do not smell like orange-ore paint[ I dont want the big bad to have a good nose. He already has the almost men.
* Their are only 8 Gift Givers in the world. With one fell folly, you reveal your lie. I know I should not blame you pissants, for long have I been away. There was a time when you’d not have even dare talk to me much less bluff me. I blame myself. I did not show my seriousness at the start. “
He shoved his boot down, cracking a bone between Jason’s chest.
“I shall start now. I am your new Ruler. Your lands are now my lands. Your meat is now mine to use. Your children, mine to play with. You can not win. You cannot stand. I am the Executioner, the ChosenKiller, I am…
v1

Take the above and make it less campy. Remove all the secondary world references.
Their are but eight Gift Givers yet you present me with a crowd? You think these Words of Power come from bazaar? You think I a fool?” He leaned in, indenting Jason’s neckline further. 
“You pissants need to be reminded of who I am. I have decided to let you all live. But to sooth my pride requires a punishment. A pile of severed legs, to start with, and maybe more limbs to follow. For, as of right now, your souls belong to me. On your lips you will sing my praises, …
v2 (still too trite)

I really want this big Bad to be a normal human with too much power that got more and more. Like a Hero who has a tantrum and stopped seeing human beings as fellow humans anymore. He has been tricked and he needs to make himself whole again. He has to remove the tricksters so it erases his own weakness.
Like a retroactive time travel. 

I would like to see Franklin rush in to save the MC, and the MC would just hold punch the shit out of Franklin, like a backhand. 
Starts laughing himself.
“Rich. Truly rich. The Holy Killer of the Chosen almost tricked into believing a Bargainer had arrived to this pitiful excuse for a planet to do battle. You will all have to die now, of course, to ensure that my pride stays intact. It wouldnt do if the Others found out. After all, I am the Great…

v3 (I don’t like this one either)

You think I a fool, Mouths of Power are gifts given by the Exiled Five yet you bring forth a dozen users? Does my legend not remain on this backwood planet? Has the cautionary tale of those who betray the Chosenkiller  been lost through the Ages? No matter, I shall remind you pissants who I am. I am the ChosenKiller, First among Equals, I am—


Mario 8/28/22, 10:51 PM]. I’ve sacked entire nations for less affront. It’s time I reminded you pissants who I am, I am—”
“The Great Ornias?” Jason grunted. “Well, I’m the Great Jason[ The word count is too high but if I could find a subtraction I would love to add:
For ten-thousand rings, I’ve ruled you, when you were fur and tail, I know now I must remind you of your past servitude. … something like that so Jason can respond with. “Well I’m Jason, and I’m ten rings old. Fuck you.”
Mario 8/29/22, 8:46 PM], son of Tanner, of Icholo. Fuck you[ I need to foreshadow this profanity and remove Fuck you but keep the essence.
Mario 8/29/22, 8:38 PM].”
With that, he activated the Bargain, felt the Mouth swivel onto his forehead. The Word of Power resounded, causing unbearable heat to gush into a single point on his forehead, like liquid fire siphoned into a lancet-tip. And then, he was no more.

	When the boy woke up, he saw a figure with long hair hover over him. His head rested upon some soft thing. She patted his head.
	Some unintelligible gibberish came forth from her mouth. With each syllable, the pounding in his head grew louder. She pointed at him, repeating the word “Jason” several times. She pointed at herself, and said Mal—something?—his stomach rumbled, either queasy from pain, or from pangs of hunger.
	“Jason,” he said, pointing at himself. The girl was happy. Then, he pointed at her, saying, “Jason!”Angrily, she shoved a brown crusty object into his hands, and stomped away. He sniffed. Instinctively, he took a bite. Soft!
	As he ate his crusty, he scanned his surroundings. Large men were handing out crusties. Weird-faced men were being dragged off in chains. He must not make these people angry. He would try his best. 
	An uncomfortable clamminess grew between his pants[ As much as I would want the MC to show an emasculating moment to a female, it might be a bit cliche. 
Mario 8/30/22, 12:01 AM]. Something liquid, and warm. He wailed. A large thumping sound approached him, and the resulting dirt-cloud made him cough. The source? A man had come, smelling of sweat and salt. The boy wished that this man would stop cradling his head. The man’s other arm was wrapped, and would shiver when jostled. Maybe it hurt like how his own head hurt? He much preferred the girl. She was less hairy, and smelled nice. The man mumbled a string of words—containing multiple mentions of  ‘Jason’ but the word still meant nothing.
	The man laid the the boy’s head down, then cleaned the boy’s lower regions despite protests. The clamminess the boy felt in his nethers vanished, replaced by comfort and smoothness.
	“Jason?” said the boy, pointing to his benefactor.
	The man laughed, took the boy’s finger, placed it upon his own forehead, and said, “Franklun, son of Locoin.”
	The boy squirmed. Did the man want him to do something? 
	Eventually, the man pointed to him, and spoke slowly. “Jason. Jason. Son of Franklun. ”
	This made him happy. Excitedly, he repeated  “Jason”, the only word he understood, until he tired. As his eyelids closed, he felt the man’s arm sway to and fro, which made him happy, made him feel secure. These feelings lessened the thumping he felt in head, and then, he was no more, into the dark of sleep he went.
	
	





Six Rings Later
Jason had never attended a banquet before. He was too young, his tutor had said, even though Jason was two hands taller than Tutor Danol himself. Jason’s attention wandered to the savory smell of roast groundling wafting in from the roof. He climbed through the hatch, feeling the cool, morning wind nip softly across his face. Where was that food?
A row of stone-faced soldiers lined each teeth of the railing. Every length of ten-men, flapped a numbered pennant—one…two…ten…counting any further than ten made his brain hurt.
“The teeth are called merlons,” panted Danol. “The gaps are crenels. The way you count with your fingers reflects poorly on me.”
Jason helped lift Danol out of the hatch, careful not to squeeze too hard on his teacher’s brittle bones. Then, he ran away before Danol could lecture him any further. 
“Watch your step, Sur Jason,” smiled Brawen. “Danol, you’ll have to head back. Only Locoin clansmen beyond this point.” While Danol argued, Jason beamed proudly. The recent summer had given him a growth spurt; most soldiers met his gaze at eye level.  
Today, they were eating dinner atop the gatewall. Their view was an ugly courtyard, filled with practice-scarecrows with heads full of arrows, and boxes of half-used gypsum-sheets from the cadet Paperers. Then he arrived to the tent, he noticed something strange afoot: Margolwen wore a proper dress, the kind she complained she couldn’t fight in, red carpeted floors, the kind that could trip a man’s feet, throw them over the railing to certain doom, and the good plates were being used.
“Sit down, son,” said Father. He motioned to the seat beside him but Jason sat next to sister, instead.  A halo of grey,  a color of discomfort , leaked from Father. Jason didn’t want to sit near that.
“Oh hush, Franklun,” said Margolwen. “Let the boy sit where he wants. He can keep me company.” Ever since Father remarried, she titled him informally, rarely calling him Father.
Jason heaved a helping of mashed steamed-bird onto his plate.
“You must be confused,” said Franklun between gulps of water. “Normally, you would not be allowed near military grounds but today will be different. We are about to meet with someone that…someone important that…” 
“Out with it, Father,” Margolwen said. Her finger tapped the the embroidered tablecloth.
“Alright, then. All at once, like ripping a poultice,” said Franklun, scratching his stubble. “Jason. You’ve always been curious about the matter of your adoption. But because of your condition…” 
Jason’s nape heated. He was the dim-witted adopted son of the great Franklun. His brain may be slow,  but his ear worked just fine. He hated when people tiptoed around him.
Franklun did not finish his sentence, but drank until the pitcher emptied. Then, he spoke: “You are to be kept in the dark no longer. Margolwen, and your tutors have convinced me that you can handle the concepts. You are full grown now, and a man should know where he is from. I think it time I tell you the rest of your story. ”
Margol gave Jason’s hand a squeeze.
“ Six rings ago, a new Magistrate had come upon your area. Cruel, and wanting to prove himself, he made an example of anyone who would harbor fugitives. Your father was found guilty, then publicly executed. Your town was torched.”
Jason saw the soldiers around him fidget; when he caught their glances, they darted their eyes downward.
“The Great Famine was at its height then, and starvation rampaged amongst you. A merchant friend of your father, took pity, allowed you and the other Icholoins to join his caravan, to see you safely as you sought refuge in bigger towns. I was the lead escort guard—a failure, at that! We were beset by an army of monsters, but you…Son, you came out of nowhere, saved my hide . What magic you employed, I can’t even guess—that answer is as lost to us as your shattered mind.”
“Right hero, you were,” muttered Davy, scratching a long scar on his sleeveless arrow-drawing arm.
“Even at the dire-most, you thought solely of your fellow townsmen, begging that I care after them in the aftermath. I’ve tried. Due no great effort on my part, most of them have flourished. The craftsman, the more self-able, I settled into my own sleepy village. The younglings, orphaned by the Famine, I sent to train with my old teachers. My village is now, thanks to your brethren, a bustling town renowned for leather craft. As for the orphans, most have returned to me, fully grown men, surprisingly gifted in magic. One journey mage can employ a dozen men. The Locoin Agency currently houses ten-and-five in journey-mages, plus scores of juniors. The Mercers Guild respect good investments, and my standing with them has risen, along with my opportunities for profit. And now, at the end of winter, at the start of a New Ring, I am to receive a commission to command the garrison in famed Pullar. It is a great honor.”
“It also means,” Margol simplified. “Our debt to you has increased.”
Had Father’s eyes ever been so shadowed, thought Jason. So grey? 
“The traditions of my house require debts be paid in full before I grow old, and unable to settle,” Franklun said. He dropped his previous composure, and his words poured out: “Three. Three men, most responsible: the one who made the fatal wound on your father, the one who burnt the town to the ground knowing full well that without stored grain, the famine would eat you all alive, and the ungrateful snot who betrayed your father’s trust. I know their locations. I know the name of their master. I have papered an opportunity to end them.”
The soldiers around the table , all knelt, draping their fingers lightly across their right shoulders. Even sister was kneeling.
“Aside from my daughter, all soldiers present are your fellow Icholoins; they owe you their lives. They share your enemy,” said Franklun. “If you are willing to go to war, so are they.”
“No,” said Jason.
“You answer without thought. Let me explain—”
Jason kicked a table leg, “Stop! I may not be the smartest. But this math, I can do.” He stood up. “If you all were to take revenge on my behalf then you, sister—” He pointed to the soldiers, to familiar faces such as  “Brawen” who grinned perpetually at some jest he only knew, to Kevic whose long face resembled a horse, and then to Davy, who was a crack shot at a hundred paces, saying, “—What if they get hurt? On my behalf? Why would I want that?” 
Jason continued: “Tutor Danol taught me that you needed to dig four ditches before charting a course for revenge. One for your dog, one for your toys, and one for the other person.” 
Brawen choked out a laugh. His best friend, Kevic, elbowed him. 
“Whatever you think you owe me—close the book on it,” said Jason. “I’m happy being your son—What is that noise?”
The commotion came from the below, to the southern gates. Bobbing up and down the dusty road were colorful flags, upon which stitched the insignia of a red-bay Pegasus. Two columns of knights streamed into the courtyard, followed by an odd-looking carriage. Strapped where horses should be floated a bubbling cauldron covered with gear-teeth, gnashing its way through a roll of fabric being fed to it by two Paper-mages. The drunken tale-spinners at the pavilion had not been lying after all. War-engines DID exist. 
Franklun, leaned in. “That noise is your enemy. Like me, he has risen far in this world. He, a little higher, from tax collector to a blasted peerage.” He spat out every word. “Duke Basuru. You will never have a better chance than now to remove him.”
Jason was silent. He could not process. He had said no, didn’t he? But within him, something sparked, some angry flame. He wanted. His mind did not remember his true father’s death but his body somehow did. He shook.
Jason was unprepared for the colors. Equal parts black and red, Jason’s knees buckled under the visual assault of the terrible feelings generating around him.
“It’s decided, then,” said Franklun softly, wiping away Jason’s tears. “May the Tetrad protect us.”










For such a great man, only a handful of knights accompanied the Duke up to the banquet tent. 
	“Unless he learnt how to reverse time, that’s not the Duke,” Brawen said, scratching his ear where a tattooed head of an Ice Turtle peaked out. 
 The Not-Duke wore a robe of red. Dense concentric rings of white rune-writings rippled from his chest. Sleeping atop his shoulder was a small bird, blue in color. Both its legs were manacled in some whitish light. The Not-Duke was young, looked to be the same age as Jason, smelled like…something familiar. Jason couldn’t quite pin where he’d seen him before.
The youth, when he reached the stairs, whistled appreciatively toward the banquet table. 		“Sadly, you’re lavish welcome has gone a-wasted,” said the youth, twirling a black folded fan between his fingers. “I’m not the Duke.”
	“I gathered that, my young lord,” said Franklun.
	“Would you like to guess who I am?”
	“Your full title would be: the Dextral Honorable Marquis, Batsun Baturin, the youngest son of his Grace, Duke Baturu,” said Franklun. He rolled up a sleeve to reveal a burn mark. “We’ve met before. The burn on your right hand is from the Socimena campaign, as is mine. It was a trying time. I don’t blame my lord for not remembering a lowly sell-sword.”
	“The Southerners did love using fire,” Batsun said. Turning his back, he rested his body precariously over the ledge of a crenel. “I’m sorry. I was never one for remembering faces. But I assure you, that battle was memorable for me, just in other ways. One never forgets their first failure.”
	“My lord?”
	“Hah,” said Batsun. “I agree. Small talk is for lesser men,” said Batsun. “Very well. I require three things. Firstly, all this food is a waste.” 
	Jason was barely listening. He was more interested in the bird on Batsun’s shoulder. So tiny. And the feathers! What a brilliant shade of blue.
The bird opened its beak: “—He’s seen your father whip a general’s face for serving summer meats in winter. You can’t blame him for keeping you at arm’s length.” which made Batsun choke a grin.
Jason almost fell out his chair. He looked to Margol, expecting her to share in his surprise but she only hushed him, shoveled more food into his mouth.
Batsun continued: “The Grain Famine is only just ended. Your soldiers are free to take the food home. As their new commander, it would endear them to you, help you along your way to curry their favor. Report all the expenses to my Scriber.” A smaller man in purple robes walked forward, dragged Kevic aside to talk about numbers, and barrels, and boringness; Jason instantly regretted eavesdropping. 
“Secondly, I intend to speak to you alone,” continued Batsun.  “The chapel, under the war-room, is my preference but since you are the keep commander, I defer to your choice.”
“If it is a private matter, then I think it wise we convene in my study.” Franklun loosened a shoulder counter-clockwise. Margo leaned into Jason’s ear, and hissed: “finish your food quickly.” 
“Fine,” said Batsun, still focused on Franklun. “The third matter shall be discussed there then. Lead the way, Commander.”
Jason stared at their backs. Soon, Kevic’s assistants were bring waves of grateful soldiers padding their knapsacks with various meats and fruits. 
Margol yanked his collar. “Come on.”
“Where are we going?.” 
“And ruin the surprise?” Margol laughed, as she dragged Jason through a series of stairs, then through dark crevices leading to cramped rooms, corridors and murder-holes, all of which smelled of urine and dust. She brought a thick scarf of orange paper near her mouth, and ground her teeth in such a way that sparks appeared, causing a faint smell of burnt ash to waft forth. She slapped the talisman upon Jason’s mouth. An outside force suddenly clamped down on Jason jaws and throat, rendering him unable to even hum. Another door opened, and Jason found himself thrust inside the office, tripping over a chair and onto an oak desk. Margo’s hands reached into a dark cubby, and the oak desk vanished. Jason fell down, expecting to crack the back of his skull agains the stone floor but he was in free-fall. He flailed his arm wildly, screamed futiley, but silently; his mouth was paper-ed shut. Tumbling around in mid-air, he could see that Margol had jumped after him, diving speedily toward him, face-first, arms flung backwards. She was grinning from ear to ear.




	Jason landed squarely on his back. The ground was springy and spaced. Wind knocked out of him as his sister somersaulted in air, landing her rump squarely atop his belly. She gently pat him in the face before rolling off. 	
“Put a hand on my ankle and follow me,” she whispered, placing his hand upon her ankle. “When we get there, not a sound. If your clumsiness causes Franklun to discover my spy holes, I’ll lose the only entertainment I have in this ice-swept, grassless Almost-hole. I’ll cut off all your hair. Even your eyebrows.”
The netting was tightly knit but smelled like groundling droppings. He hoped it would support his weight.   They were behind the castle walls, somehow. Some of the pitch between the stone masonry had been drilled through allowing strands of light to break up the monotony of the dark. Jason wondered how Margolwen had found out about this passage. They had arrived here for less than a moon, and, here she was, mistress supreme to all its secrets. 
They crawled up, then down, until he finally surrendered to just following his sister. She stopped. In complete darkness, he heard Margol shuffle furiously resulting in pinholes of light illuminate under her. She, red-faced with effort, urged Jason to look down and through. The light came from a glass porthole the size of large shield. 
“It isn’t magic,” she explained, nose and cheeks blackened with wall-dirt. “I think its legendary glass from the Island That Sank. Hands off though. Its mine to steal—I mean, sell.”
 Jason nodded, then cozied up for a better view angle.
The spy hole revealed a small study, similar to the one they fell through. He noted that there were thrice as many doors, that each held interlocked bolts, and each connected to a Plate, most likely Spelled to either klaxon or entrap. Upon the desk, lay a freshly drawn map of the Pullar Region. Pullarn Wall sprawled across the map like a small snake, while, north of the wall, small carets represented the Wayposts, self-sustained villages where hot meals, and lukewarm baths awaited weary miners, or the occasional Turtle Hunting expeditions. 
Small, clay sculptures of Ice Turtles, and other monsters scattered over the table, some weighing the map down, others were had tiny numbered flags stuck unceremoniously atop their soft heads. 
The largest of the doors cranked open, its bolts receded, its Plate’s inscriptions faded. It was Father and the Dukeling Batsun. Jason knew he was supposed to be quiet, hence the gag on his mouth, but his bladder was calling desperately—Margol would hear none of it. She held a finger vertically against her upper lip. 
Jason sank into his fingertips, distracting himself with the ongoing conversation below them.
